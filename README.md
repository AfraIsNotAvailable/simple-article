## Technologies in use
[![Technologies](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=html,css)](https://skillicons.dev)

## A few things I learned/got better at

- working with `div` better
- where to use more general classes in `css` to give the website a more :sparkles:unified:sparkles: look
- **pseudo-classes**
- defining a somewhat *general structure* so that it makes sense to me as much as to the user

## Some improvements?

Well...I don't know yet. I don't know enough yet

## Credits

The original page I got the design from -> [here](https://cs.fyi/guide/web-development-101-beginners-guide)
As well as the icon at the top I found on a project on Figma -> [here](https://www.figma.com/file/nh0V05z3NB87ue9v5PcO3R/writings.dev?type=design&node-id=0-1&mode=design&t=PKLCuhEGC6F0AEAI-0)

Almost nothing original. The purpose was to get more familiar with the tools.
