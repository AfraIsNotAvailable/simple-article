                        Web development is the process of building websites and
                        applications for the internet, or for a private network
                        known as an intranet. Web development is not concerned
                        with the design of a website; rather, it's all about the
                        coding and programming that powers the website's
                        functionality.
                    </p>
                    <h2>What is a Website?</h2>
                    <p class="p-text">
                        A website is a collection of web pages that are publicly
                        accessible on the internet. A web page is a document
                        that contains text, images, videos, and other elements
                        that are displayed in a web browser. A web browser is a
                        software application that allows you to view and
                        interact with websites, such as Google Chrome, Firefox,
                        or Safari.
                    </p>
                    <p class="p-text">
                        Some websites are simple, consisting of only a few
                        pages, while others are more complex, with hundreds of
                        pages. The size of a website is not a measure of its
                        quality, and it’s possible to build a website with a
                        small number of pages that is more useful than a website
                        with hundreds of pages.
                    </p>
                    <h2>What is a URL?</h2>
                    <p class="p-text">
                        To access a website, you need to know its address, which
                        is also called a URL (Uniform Resource Locator). A URL
                        is a string of characters that uniquely identifies a
                        resource on the internet. For example, the URL for this
                        page is
                        <code
                            >https://cs.fyi/web-development-101-beginners-guide</code
                        >. To learn more about URLs, check out our

                    <h2>How does a website work?</h2>
                    <p class="p-text">
                        A website works by following a client-server model. The
                        client is your browser, which sends requests to the
                        server and receives responses from it. The server is a
                        computer that hosts the website and handles the requests
                        from the clients.
                    </p>
                    <p class="p-text">
                        When you type a URL in your browser and hit enter, your
                        browser sends an HTTP request to the server that hosts
                        the website. The server then processes the request and
                        sends back an HTTP response that contains the web page
                        or an error message. The browser then renders the web
                        page and displays it to you.
                    </p>
                    <p class="p-text">
                        The web page that you see in your browser is usually
                        written in HTML (HyperText Markup Language), which is
                        the standard markup language for creating web pages.
                        HTML consists of elements that define the structure and
                        content of the web page. HTML elements are enclosed by
                        tags, which indicate how they should be displayed or
                        behave.
                    </p>
                    <p class="p-text">
                        For example,
                        <code>&lt;p&gt;My cat is very grumpy&lt;/p&gt;</code> is
                        an HTML element that represents a paragraph of text. The
                        opening tag (<code>&lt;p&gt;</code>) indicates where the
                        paragraph begins, and the closing tag
                        (<code>&lt;&#47;p&gt;</code>) indicates where it ends.
                    </p>
                    <p class="p-text">
                        HTML alone can create static websites, where the content
                        does not change based on user input or interaction.
                        However, if you want to make your website dynamic
                        (manage files and databases, add contact forms, control
                        user-access, etc.), you need to use a programming
                        language that can run on the server-side.
                    </p>
                    <p class="p-text">
                        Some of the most popular server-side programming
                        languages are PHP, Python, Ruby, Java, and JavaScript
                        (Node.js). These languages can communicate with
                        databases, such as MySQL or MongoDB, to store and
                        retrieve data for your website.
                    </p>
                    <p class="p-text">
                        On the other hand, if you want to make your website more
                        interactive and responsive on the client-side, you need
                        to use JavaScript, which is a scripting language that
                        can run in your browser. JavaScript can manipulate HTML
                        elements, add animations and effects, validate user
                        input, fetch data from external sources, and more.
                    </p>
                    <p class="p-text">
                        JavaScript can also use frameworks and libraries, such
                        as jQuery, React, Angular, or Vue.js, to simplify and
                        enhance its functionality.
                    </p>
                    <h2>What is Hosting?</h2>
                    <p class="p-text">
                        When you create a website, you need a place to store
                        your files, such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and images.
                        This is where hosting comes in. Web hosting is a service
                        that allows you to store your website files on a server
                        that is accessible on the internet.
                    </p>
                    <p class="p-text">
                        There are many different types of hosting services, such
                        as shared hosting, dedicated hosting, VPS hosting, and
                        cloud hosting. Shared hosting is the most common type of
                        hosting for beginners, as it’s affordable and easy to
                        set up. With shared hosting, you share a server with
                        other websites, which can affect the speed and
                        performance of your website.
                    </p>
                    <p class="p-text">
                        Dedicated hosting, on the other hand, gives you complete
                        control over a server, but it’s more expensive and
                        requires more technical knowledge. VPS hosting is a
                        middle ground between shared and dedicated hosting,
                        where you have a virtual private server that is
                        dedicated to your website, but you still share physical
                        resources with other websites.

                        Cloud hosting is a newer type of hosting that uses a
                        network of servers to store and distribute your website
                        files, which can improve reliability and scalability.
                        With cloud hosting, you pay for what you use, which can
                        make it more cost-effective for websites with varying
                        traffic.
